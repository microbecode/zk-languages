# Various ZK languages

This repository introduces various ZK languages via a simple program, which is as similar as possible for each language.

The used program has the following characteristics:

- It has two inputs: `a` and `b`. Of these, `a` is a private input (if the language supports privacy) and `b` is public
- It has one public output, which is the multiple of `a` and `b`.

The program, therefore, demonstrates how to write a ZK program where you can prove that you know a private `a` so that `a * b = c`.

## Stand-alone and contracts

ZK languages can usually be used at least as stand-alone. This means that proofs generated for ZK programs or for ZK-VM executions.

Some languages (or the ecosystems around them) support also ZK smart contracts (or zkApps). In this case, the same multiplication code is also expressed in a contract format, which typically differs from the stand-alone version.

Do note that especially the contract format evolves rapidly in all ecosystems. Anything written here may be outdated already the day after it's written.

### Folder structure

All folders under the root folder are based on the language's name. Under that, there is a README and a `standalone` folder, which contains the stand-alone programs with that language.

If the language has smart contract capabilities, they are demonstrated in a `contract` folder.

## Differences

The languages folders have at least the following possible differences:

- Different technologies, so different required files and instructions
- Some languages generate proofs explicitly, some do things more in the background
- Some languages don't have local proving available at all, currently
- Some languages support privacy, while others don't
- Some languages require a trusted setup
- Some languages (or ecosystems around the language) support ZK smart contracts
